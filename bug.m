In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some other code ...
}
@end
```

While seemingly correct, if `someMethod` is called multiple times without releasing `myString`, it leads to a memory leak. Even though ARC handles most retain/release, repeated assignments without proper handling create a strong reference cycle that prevents deallocation.

Another less obvious issue could be related to KVO (Key-Value Observing). If you register for KVO notifications but forget to remove them in `dealloc` or when the observed object's lifecycle ends, it can result in crashes or unexpected behavior. This is especially problematic if you are observing objects across different view controllers or during complex state transitions.
